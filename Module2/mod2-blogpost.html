            <h2>Description:</h2>

            <p>For those currently without the space or capacity for real-life plants, this project offers a virtual plant. By interacting with hardware components that directly influence your virtual plant&apos;s growth, you can nurture your plant and receive satisfaction from seeing it grow! This can also be a stepping stone to a future real-life plant, as you can get in the habit of taking care of one. </p>
            <p>In terms of hardware, this project primarily uses a TTGO T1 display board with built-in ESP32 microcontroller, a button, and a potentiometer. For software, I used the Python library Pygame to render the game environment, which features the pot of the plant, a watering unit, and curtains in the background.  Pressing the button waters the plant, and toggling the potentiometer affects how closed/open the background curtains are. </p>

As you can see, there is also a count of how many game days have passed since the start of the game (the genesis of the plant), as well as a status indicator on whether the plant has been watered today. There are also instructions for keyboard interactions the user can do. </p>

            <h2>Game Mechanics (Plant Care and Growth):</h2>
            <p>Plant growth relies on 2 factors: whether it has been watered “today”, and whether the curtains are in an optimal range. The optimal range for the curtains is unknown to the user, encouraging the user to guess and check. This encourages more interaction and is also more realistic to plant care. If both requirements are met, the plant grows, and this growth is simulated the next “day” within the game. Otherwise, if one or both conditions were not met, consequences based on the missing conditions occur: the plant shrinks a certain amount the next day, and the color of the plant might change to a light gray.             </p>
            
            <h2>Creative Decisions:</h2>
            <p>Importantly, I programmed the game to have a mechanism where the passage of time affects the plant's condition, even when the game isn't actively running.  By tracking the last load time and calculating the elapsed in-game days from that, I create a sense of continuous time, reflecting the result in the day counter and in the plant’s condition. This approach enhances the realism of plant care in the game, encouraging users to regularly return and engage with their virtual plant. </p>
            <p>I currently have the time running so that each minute counts as a day within the game. I also have it so that the check for whether the plant should grow or decay is at the start of each new "day." This was done so that plant growth could be seen in faster time. However, I'm thinking for future work that I could change it so that a day in the game is an actual day in real life, and the check of whether a plant's conditions have been met or not could happen at the start of a new week. This could give a lot more realism. </p>
            <p>I also decided to include keyboard events, namely pressing the 's' key to skip to the next day, so that the user could immediately see the effect of the plant's conditions on the plant's growth, as well as pressing the 'r' key to reset the entire game.</p>
            <p>Visually, I made the game so that when you reach certain levels of plant height, leaves sprout, but when the plant shrinks below those levels, the leaves disappear.             </p>
            
            <h2>Technical Challenge:</h2>
            <p>The main technical challenge was programming the internal timing of the game. I made two global variables, a dict named game_state and a date time named start_time, which recorded the start time of the game. I made several functions that operated around game_state, such as initialize_game_state(), load_game_state(), and save_game_state(), all of which have pretty straightforward functionality. I also made a function update_day_counter() that checked the current time of the game and the start time to calculate how many internal days have elapsed. </p>
            <p>Implementing these mechanics helped with the internal timing of the system. However, I still had a big issue with coordinating when to update the plant growth, as the function update_plant_growth() was getting called too quickly. I originally called the function before calling my draw function, both within the main loop, as I thought this would mean the plant would always be accurate. However, it made more sense if the plant changed upon the start of a new day, so that the changes could be grouped together. I discovered that if I called the function only within the update_day_counter() function and only when a new day has elapsed, then I could prevent this issue and keep the checking of the plant’s conditions at a regular time - at the start of a new day.</p>
