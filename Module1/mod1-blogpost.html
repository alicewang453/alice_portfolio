            <p>This Valentine's Day, we took the celebration to the next level by integrating love with technology. Our project, an ESP32 installation, illuminates LED lights in sync with heartbeats, capturing the essence of connection and affection.</p>
            <p>The installation uses an ESP32 microcontroller to detect heartbeat signals through a pulse sensor. When a heartbeat is detected, a series of LEDs light up, creating a visual representation of the heart's rhythm. It's not just an electronic project; it's a fusion of technology, art, and emotion.</p>
            <h2>How We Built It</h2>
            <p>The project required careful planning and execution. Here's a brief overview of our process:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Designing the circuit layout and selecting components.</li>
                <li>Programming the ESP32 to read heartbeat signals.</li>
                <li>Creating a responsive LED lighting system.</li>
                <li>Assembling the components and testing the installation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For those interested in creating something similar, we've shared the code and schematics on our GitHub. This project is a testament to the power of technology to express human emotions and connect us in new and exciting ways.</p>
